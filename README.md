# Distance Calculator with Google Maps API

## Description

This project is a web application that uses the Google Maps Distance Matrix API to calculate and display the distance between two locations. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app allows users to input two addresses or coordinates and get the distance and travel time between them.

## Features

- Calculate distance and travel time between two locations
- Support for addresses and coordinates
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Interactive user interface


## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your web browser.**

    You can do this by simply double-clicking the file or using a local server if you prefer.

## Google Maps API Key

To use the Google Maps Distance Matrix API, you need a valid API key. Follow these steps to get your API key:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Navigate to **API & Services** > **Credentials**.
4. Click on **Create Credentials** and select **API key**.
5. Restrict your API key as needed and copy it.

Add your API key to the `script.js` file or include it in your configuration as shown below:

```javascript
function calculateDistance() {
    var service = new google.maps.DistanceMatrixService();
    service.getDistanceMatrix(
        {
            origins: [originAddress],
            destinations: [destinationAddress],
            travelMode: 'DRIVING'
        },
        function(response, status) {
            if (status === 'OK') {
                var results = response.rows[0].elements;
                document.getElementById('result').innerHTML =
                    'Distance: ' + results[0].distance.text + '<br>' +
                    'Duration: ' + results[0].duration.text;
            } else {
                console.error('Error:', status);
            }
        }
    );
}
```

Include the API key in your HTML file within the `<script>` tag:

```html
<script async defer
src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initMap">
</script>
```

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter the origin and destination addresses or coordinates in the input fields.
3. Click the "Calculate Distance" button to view the distance and travel time between the two locations.

## Files

- `index.html` - The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the page.
- `styles.css` - Contains the CSS styles for the application.
- `script.js` - Contains JavaScript code to handle Google Maps API requests and display results.
